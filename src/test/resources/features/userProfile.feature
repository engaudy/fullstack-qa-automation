  @wip
  Scenario: Simulate a change in the user's personal information and verify the changes persist
    # Given the user is logged in
    # When the user navigates to the profile or account settings page
    # And the user updates their personal information
    # And the user saves the changes
    # Then the system should display a success message
    # And the updated information should persist after reloading or logging back in
